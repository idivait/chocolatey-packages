My custom build Chocolatey Packages.

## NVIDIA GeForce Now
An auto-installer for the NVIDIA GeForce Now streaming software.

`choco install nvidia-geforce-now`

[Package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nvidia-geforce-now)

[Homepage](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/products/geforce-now/)

Since NVIDIA has a very fast release cycle for it's software, the package is tested at least once a week on a Monday. A new package will be generated more often if someone reports the installer is broken.

## PHP Manager for IIS
PHP version manager for Internet Information Services.

`choco install php-manager`
